NAME
    heatmapper - Make heatmaps of biological communities

VERSION
    This document refers to heatmapper version 0.9

SYNOPSIS
      heatmapper -i otu_table.txt

DESCRIPTION
    Heatmapper runs heatmap.2 in R to generate a heatmap. This script
    automates the process and add options to add taxonomic labels, color by
    taxon taxon, have a logarithmic scale and use color palettes with
    multiple colors.

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
    -i <input_file>
        A tab-separated community table in site-by-species matrix format.
        Rows represent different species while columns are the different
        sites (or samples). Row and column names (headers) are expected, and
        although it is not enforced, the sum of all species is expected to
        add up to 100. Taxonomic assignments should be semi- colon
        delimited, such as in the Greengenes or Silva formats, e.g.:

           k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII;g__
           Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Thermoplasmata;E2;MarinegroupII;Other

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
    -m <matrix_file>
        Instead of performing the hierarchical clustering of the communities
        based on their euclidean distance, you can provide a tab-delimited
        matrix containing the distance of your choice (e.g. Unifrac
        distance).

    -t <taxonomy_level>
        Specify at which taxonomy level to colorize: 'k'ingdom, 'p'hylum,
        'c'lass, 'o'rder, 'f'amily, 'g'enus or 's'pecies. Default: k

    -l <legend_taxonomy>
        Specify how to display the taxonomy on the heatmap:

        full: the entire taxonomy string (e.g.
        k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII
        ),

        local: the taxonomic group specified with the -t option (e.g.
        p__Euryarchaeota) only,

        auto: everything that comes after 'local' (e.g.
        p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII),

        first: the first element of the taxonomy (e.g. k__Archaea),

        last: the last element of the taxonomy (e.g. f__MarinegroupII).

        Default: auto

    -p <palette_col>
        Palette of colors to use: * Jet : a 32-color palette going from blue
        to green to red * Jet2: another 32-color jet palette that starts
        with darker blue, has less cyan in the middle, and ends with lighter
        red. * any sequential RColorBrewer
        <http://svitsrv25.epfl.ch/R-doc/library/RColorBrewer/html/ColorBrewe
        r.html> color palette (8-colors): Blues BuGn BuPu GnBu Greens Greys
        Oranges OrRd PuBu PuBuGn PuRd Purples RdPu Reds YlGn YlGnBu YlOrBr
        YlOrRd Default: Jet

    -n <na_col>
        For species with an abundance of zero, instead of using the color
        specified by <palette_col>, use the plot background color. This
        makes it easier to distinguish between species that were present at
        low abundance and species that were not observed at all. Default: 0

    -h <hierarch_clust>
        Whether or not to cluster the samples hierarchically and display a
        dendrogram (0: no, 1: yes). Note: Do not use if you have grouped
        low-abundance OTUs or species into an "Other" category. Default: 0

    -o <output_name>
        File path where to create the output graph. Note that the file
        extension specifies which graphic format to use: SVG, PDF, PNG, etc.
        Default: heatmapper.svg

    -s <width>x<height>
        Size (width and height) of the output image, in pixels. If you get
        an error message about margins being too large, you might have to
        increase the weight or height. Default: 20x20

EXAMPLES
    *   SVG output with phylum-level colors

        heatmapper -i otu_table.txt -s 30x5

    *   PNG output, coloring at the order taxonomic level

        heatmapper -i otu_table.txt -t o -s 5000x1000 -o heatmap.png

INSTALLATION
  Dependencies
    You need to install these dependencies first:

    *   Perl

        <http://www.perl.com/download.csp>

    *   make

        Many systems have make installed by default. If your system does
        not, you should install the implementation of make of your choice,
        e.g. GNU make: <http://www.gnu.org/s/make/>

    *   R

        <http://www.r-project.org>

        You also need these two R libraries: gplots, RColorBrewer

    The following CPAN Perl modules are dependencies that will be installed
    automatically for you:

    *   Getopt::Euclid (>= 0.3.4)

    *   Statistics::R

  Procedure
    To install HeatMapper globally on your system, run the following
    commands in a terminal or command prompt:

    On Linux, Unix, MacOS:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make

    And finally, with administrator privileges:

       make install

    On Windows, run the same commands but with nmake instead of make.

  No administrator privileges?
    If you do not have administrator privileges, HeatMapper needs to be
    installed in your home directory.

    First, follow the instructions to install local::lib at
    <http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.008004/lib/local/lib.pm#The
    _bootstrapping_technique>. After local::lib is installed, every Perl
    module that you install manually or through the CPAN command-line
    application will be installed in your home directory.

    Then, install HeatMapper by following the instructions detailed in the
    "Procedure" section.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Credits go to Dana Willner for showing me R's heatmap.2 and for writing
    the initial code for coloring taxa. Heatmapper was built on top of these
    foundations.

BUGS
    There are undoubtedly serious bugs lurking somewhere in this code. Bug
