=head1 NAME

heatmapper - Make heatmaps of biological communities

=head1 VERSION

This document refers to heatmapper version 0.9 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  heatmapper -i otu_table.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Heatmapper runs heatmap.2 in R to generate a heatmap. This script automates the
process and add options to add taxonomic labels, color by taxon taxon, have a
logarithmic scale and use color palettes with multiple colors.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=over

=item -i <input_file>

A tab-separated community table in site-by-species matrix format. Rows represent
different species while columns are the different sites (or samples). Row and
column names (headers) are expected, and although it is not enforced, the sum of
all species is expected to add up to 100. Taxonomic assignments should be semi-
colon delimited, such as in the Greengenes or Silva formats, e.g.:

   k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII;g__
   Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Thermoplasmata;E2;MarinegroupII;Other

=back



=head1 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=over

=item -m <matrix_file>

Instead of performing the hierarchical clustering of the communities based on
their euclidean distance, you can provide a tab-delimited matrix containing the
distance of your choice (e.g. Unifrac distance).

=item -t <taxonomy_level>

Specify at which taxonomy level to colorize: 'k'ingdom, 'p'hylum, 'c'lass,
'o'rder, 'f'amily, 'g'enus or 's'pecies. Default: k

=item -l <legend_taxonomy>

Specify how to display the taxonomy on the heatmap:

full: the entire taxonomy string (e.g. k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII),

local: the taxonomic group specified with the -t option (e.g. p__Euryarchaeota) only,

auto: everything that comes after 'local' (e.g. p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII),

first: the first element of the taxonomy (e.g. k__Archaea),

last: the last element of the taxonomy (e.g. f__MarinegroupII).

Default: auto

=item -p <palette_col>

Palette of colors to use:
  * Jet : a 32-color palette going from blue to green to red
  * Jet2: another 32-color jet palette that starts with darker blue, has less cyan in
          the middle, and ends with lighter red.
  * any sequential L<RColorBrewer|http://svitsrv25.epfl.ch/R-doc/library/RColorBrewer/html/ColorBrewer.html> color palette (8-colors):
          Blues BuGn BuPu GnBu Greens Greys Oranges OrRd PuBu PuBuGn PuRd
          Purples RdPu Reds YlGn YlGnBu YlOrBr YlOrRd
Default: Jet

=item -n <na_col>

For species with an abundance of zero, instead of using the color specified by
<palette_col>, use the plot background color. This makes it easier to
distinguish between species that were present at low abundance and species that
were not observed at all. Default: 0

=item -h <hierarch_clust>

Whether or not to cluster the samples hierarchically and display a dendrogram
(0: no, 1: yes). Note: Do not use if you have grouped low-abundance OTUs or
species into an "Other" category. Default: 0

=item -o <output_name>

File path where to create the output graph. Note that the file extension
specifies which graphic format to use: SVG, PDF, PNG, etc. Default: heatmapper.svg

=item -s <width>x<height>

Size (width and height) of the output image, in pixels. If you get an error
message about margins being too large, you might have to increase the weight or
height. Default: 20x20

=back



=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item * SVG output with phylum-level colors

heatmapper -i otu_table.txt -s 30x5

=item * PNG output, coloring at the order taxonomic level

heatmapper -i otu_table.txt -t o -s 5000x1000 -o heatmap.png

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Dependencies

You need to install these dependencies first:

=over

=item *

Perl

L<http://www.perl.com/download.csp>


=item *

make

Many systems have make installed by default. If your system does not, you should
install the implementation of make of your choice, e.g. GNU make: L<http://www.gnu.org/s/make/>

=item *

R

L<http://www.r-project.org>


You also need these two R libraries: gplots, RColorBrewer

=back

The following CPAN Perl modules are dependencies that will be installed automatically
for you:

=over

=item *

Getopt::Euclid (>= 0.3.4)

=item *

Statistics::R

=back

=head2 Procedure

To install HeatMapper globally on your system, run the following
commands in a terminal or command prompt:

On Linux, Unix, MacOS:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

And finally, with administrator privileges:

   make install

On Windows, run the same commands but with nmake instead of make.

=head2 No administrator privileges?

If you do not have administrator privileges, HeatMapper needs to be
installed in your home directory.

First, follow the instructions to install local::lib
at L<http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.008004/lib/local/lib.pm#The_bootstrapping_technique>.
After local::lib is installed, every Perl module that you install manually or
through the CPAN command-line application will be installed in your home directory.

Then, install HeatMapper by following the instructions detailed in
the "Procedure" section.

Credits go to Dana Willner for showing me R's heatmap.2 and for writing the
initial code for coloring taxa. Heatmapper was built on top of these foundations.

There are undoubtedly serious bugs lurking somewhere in this code.
